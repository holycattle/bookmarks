    p
      | I adapted this recipe from a book caleld
      i Sydney Food
      | by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1st visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney, I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the
      i best
      | scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.
    p
      | This recipe is what I call a "very special breakfast"; just look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be believed.
